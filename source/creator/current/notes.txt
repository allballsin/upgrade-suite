	project.


3/6/98

2/6/98

1/6/98
- Compressed files do not patch well?
- talk about clearing out the staging area.
- make help very hyperlinked.

13/5/98
- url should just be a file name in Receiving
schemas.
- for HTTP, FTP retrieval, base URL should be in Project

30/5/98
- if a hint is cut off short, resize the Creator Window so the hint
box is larger.
- ZIP.DLL must ship with creator

- when compiling, check if patch exists even if file in Staging
Area is the same as the file in the Source Directory.
- Can't have two copies of the same file in an installation.
- if you delete files out of your source directory, reimport
the directory? Even though this will stuff up your URL's ,
you can't delete the files from the object structure.

28/5/98

System in your Source Directory other than ones to deliberately
use System and Windows directories.


27/5/98

- files cannot contain a '
- if you are like me, tooltips drive you nuts, so I have
implemented hint boxes. Tell me what you think of them.

OLD

DONE The programmer probably wants settings to be separate to his/hew own receiver settings.

make sure an application has a root directory.

USER CONSIDERATIONS
- Programmers cannot use folders called root,system, or windows
- Currently assume subdirectories will not be put into Windows or System
  directories, because the folder search function does not look for them.
- Can't have two directories with same name in application ( even if they are
  in different subdirectories )
- assume Root, Windows and System are all different folders
- need the downloader installed to test
- patch directory name is reserved
- htmltest directory name is reserved

TTD
- make application file view editable
- allow multiple register instructions and shortcuts available to each new file.
- make it easier to change the name of a file
- change default location for webserver in loadsettings for release.
- an Updater program that works like the Receiver for Transmitting the files?
  only useful if on the web all the time. It could be called by the Transmitter.
- applications need upload information files, used by transmitter, created/edited by Creator
- Easy step by step wizards
- a word on security
- old patch files need to be deleted from ftp site, or new file
  will not be downloaded.
- compress whole files that get uploaded
