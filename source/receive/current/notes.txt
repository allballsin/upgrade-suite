Use this code for making a new directory when the application'
file already exists in the apps directory

{ create file. If exists put in subdirectories numbered }
dircount:=0;
while fileexists(locpath+fn) then
  begin
  inc(dircount);
  locpath:=locpath+chr(dircount)+'\';
  end;

Download graphic should link to a page with mirror sites
for the Upgrade Receiver to be downloaded.

Upgrade manager (shareware) should come with the downloader,
but is not necessary to install the program. Just to update
and remove it.
