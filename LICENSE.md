#License

###TL;DR
This is kind of tricky. 

###Discussion
In this project, I will be porting software that I wrote 18 years ago, but there is also some possibly copyrighted and proprietry code included in the original software as well.

The ported code may be mine to assign for any use but I'm not sure yet. 

Bottom line is this, so far:

- Use it at your own risk.
- Don't sell it.
- Reverse engineer the hell out of my bits :)  
- Reverse engineer the hell out of the bits that are not mine if you are allowed to in your jurisdiction.  
- The source for the bits that are not mine should be clearly marked.
- To the best of my knowledge, all the code in the original software can be posted here.
- If you find code that is yours that I have unwittingly illegally included, please let me know.  

Enjoy!
