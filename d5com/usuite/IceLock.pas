                               ==============

                       Copyright 1996,97 -  B. Walker

  See the end of this section for history information, and new features!

  Well folks, here it is, finally, the new version! This is the easiest way to
handle registration of your delphi applications.  Or, at least, the easiest
for me.  Oh, and legal stuff, this component is FreeWare, I make no
guarantees, or warranties of any kind, you use this at your own risk.  And
I definately do not guarantee it is secure.  I, and others, have tried to
hack using this, with no success...so It's probably "pretty good
protection"...nothing is perfect..

On to usage...

First, customize IceLock:

modify the following Constants:

        UserPad
        ProgPad
        MasterKey (this is an array of values for masking the record, when
                    written to a file)

** The defaults will work just fine, but, if you use the defaults, anybody
with this component can create valid keys for your applications!!. **

In the Create method modify the variable initialization for:

        fSeedVal1 { These can also be set at design time }
        fSeedVal2
        Seed { Set in the Create Method, because it's Private! }
    And any others you may wish to modify...

  This will make your copy of IceLock, ** much ** different from anybody
elses.  If you are really worried about hackers, read further into the
source, there are plenty of notes for further obfuscating the keys/files.

  Next, install this component in your component palette, it automatically
installs into the 'Samples' page.  Now, to use it, drop on your main form,
modify the properties (most particularly IceString1 and IceString2..
possibly also the KeyFileName).  And you are affectively done, for a
minimum install...call LoadK655eyFile then either check the result of
LoadKeyFile, or check the IsRegistered variable to see if it's registered.

  A better example of usage is in the IceReg application, included with
version 1.0.  This application is a fully functional database, for
tracking users/applications and keys...  Make sure that you re-build this
application, using the copy of IceLock that you have modified/installed
into delphi...otherwise, the keys created will be invalid!.

** The Most important thing to remember!!  When you create keys for users, the
** fProgKey1 and fProgKey2 must be the same when you check the key!!!  This
** is why I suggest modifying the above mentioned const/variables, and then
** specify unique IceStrings for each application, this is the easiest way to
** go...(unless you find an easier way...)

  Last bit, have fun with this...  All I ask is that you give credit where
it is due....and if you come up with cool enhancements, please send them to
me, so I can keep track of modifications, and re-release with a new version
number...  If you find a hole, that you cannot plug, let me know, again, I
can probably plug it..and re-release.


History
-------

v1.0 - Initial release, with a few buggies.  After receiving a lot of
questions and suggestions ....requests for feature, and a new version
of the source code from Jorge Cue (Thanks!), we are now at....

v2.0 - Fixed the bugs (I hope), fixed the source code to compile under
Delphi version 1, 2 AND 3!!  Added the following files, so you do not
have to recompile the library everytime you switch from different versions
of Delphi.  Note: There may still be a problem using it in Delphi1, if you
first install in 2/3, If you get Unit file format error, just erase
ICELOCK.DCU, and Delphi will rebuild it:

       ilock16.pas  : Delphi 1 component.
       ilock32.pas  : Delphi 2 component.
       ilock332.pas : Delphi 3 component.

     - All version will support the same key! (assuming your program is
     using the same IceString1 and IceString2.  Also, now the ProgramKeys
     should calculate the same for all versions.  NOTE: The key files are
     transportable in both 32-bit versions, but the 32-bit keys will not
     work in 16-bit (see below)
     - Jorge Cue had added a HDSerialNumber to the registration record.
     problem is, he had to use ASM to get the HD Serial.  This works when
     compiled using D1, but only under Win95 (or something like that).  I
     modified his GetHdSerialNumber to be a little more portable, if not
     as secure under Win3.1.  For 16-bit apps, I use GetWinFlags to get a
     longint with information about the current version and operating mode
     of windows.  Under Win32 I use the Win32 API function GetVolumeInformation
     to actually get the HD serial number.  These procedures will require
     a user to re-enter his/her Registered Name and Key if the environment/
     HD serial number changes.
     - The last change Jorge Cue implemented was, Licensetype.  In the
     code he sent me, he used an enumerated type, I changed it to a
     boolean property "DemoLicense".  This will be set to true when a user
     enters a key you have generated with DemoLicense set to true.  I also
     added a TrialDays property, that lets you select the number of days
     a trial license is good for.  This way, when a user enters their key,
     and it happens to be a demo key, the systems automatically generates
     an expiration date, and includes it in the key.  This requires that
     you program not allow them to enter the key again!  Of course,
     users could just delete the key and start again...of course you
     could modify the program to put the key somewhere strange (or even the
     registry), and maybe mark it read-only/hidden....on and on...sorry, I'm
     rambling.
     - Now LoadKey will return ieExpired or ieNotSameHD if the license
     is expired, or the environment/HDserial changes.  See error constants
     for the rest.
     - New (cheezy...and much smaller) demo program.  Very basic.  For a more
     detailed demo, get Icelock 1.0
     - Oh, and last, but not least, the source code is not as heavily
     commented as v1.0.  Sorry, but I lack the ambition to comment it again
     with all the changes.

Thanks again to Jorge Cue, and all the other folks who have given
me feedback on this (and in one case sent me a license to a spiffy
Delphi 1.0 expert!)
