WHAT IS IT?
===========

A total solution for uploading and downloading software and data over networks, intranets, and the Internet.

Three applications form the core of the Upgrade Suite:

Upgrade Receiver
- Installs and maintains distributions of software and data.
- Automatically updates your software if you wish.

Upgrade Creator
- Generates and maintains software and data distributions.

Upgrade Transmitter
- Transmits files to and removes files from local or remote file servers.


WHO BENEFITS?
=============
- Developers
- Users
- Network Administrators


HOW DO DEVELOPERS BENEFIT?
==========================

Simplified software deployment (5 Steps)
----------------------------------------
1. Create
- Automatically import entire directory structures into a software installation with zero effort.

2. Compile
- Automatically generate patches to bring users' software up to date. 

3. Test
- Automatically test your deployment on a local area network, or file server designated for testing.

4. Deploy
- Easily upload all files and patches to their Deployment Area, or just the files that have changed.

5. Link
- Create a Windows shortcut for users on your LAN, or generate HTML for pasting straight into a web editor.


Total Deployment Control
------------------------
- Automatic patching and version control maintains an arbitrary number of software versions in the Deployment Area. 
- Ability to remove files from remote Deployment Area. 


HOW DO USERS BENEFIT?
=====================

Total Download Management
-------------------------
- Backup current software installations. 
- Automatically upgrade software installations. 
- Revert to previous version of software if upgrade is buggy. 
- Uninstall software installations. 
- Windows / System file saver in case an important DLL gets deleted. 
- Download software through HTTP / FTP / Local Area Network 
- Ability to download files from different servers in a single installation 
- Ability to contact vendors right from the installer. 


HOW DO NETWORK ADMINISTRATORS BENEFIT?
======================================

- Network Administrators can redeploy software downloaded from the
Internet over their LAN to save internet bandwidth, and to maintain version control over their LAN software installations. 


HOW DOES EVERYONE BENEFIT?
==========================

Bandwidth Savings 
-----------------
- Download only the bytes you need to bring your software up to date.
- Files and software patches can be compressed automatically before deployment.

Distribute any Data
-------------------
- deploy documentation, graphics, spreadsheets and databases.
