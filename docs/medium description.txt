Three applications form the core of the Upgrade Suite. Upgrade Creator generates and maintains software and data distributions, Upgrade Transmitter transmits files to local or remote file servers, and Upgrade Receiver installs and maintains distributions of software and data -- automatically if you wish. Upgrade Receiver repairs corrupted files, and only downloads the bytes you need to bring your files up to date. Together, these programs comprise a total, integrated solution to efficient deployment of software and data over local area networks, intranets, and the Internet.
